# SquirreledAway
Squirreled Away is a squirrel simulator like game were you collect objects to survive the winter and avoid crows. It is designed to be procedurally generated, i.e. the tree placement, bush placement, collectible placement, and terrain changes each time. We did not get around to procedurally generating the crows, however. None of the assets used are ours. Where we got them is listed within the credits page of the game. 

NOTE: This is the game files and not a playable version of the game. If you would like a playable version, please reach out to jsterly@umich.edu.

Squirreled Away was the collaborative effort of Jeffrey Fishman, Jaxon Pecora, Cody Lovelace, Elise Ambriz, and Jessica Sterly. We had 2-3 weeks to complete this project so it was more than a little bit rushed and was no where near where we wanted it when we finished. However, it runs.
